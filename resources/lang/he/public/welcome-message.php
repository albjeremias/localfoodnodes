On this site you can pre-book produce that you will later pick up at listed pick up/delivery locations called nodes.',

    'welcome_paragraph4' => 'In order to place an order on the system you have to submit a yearly membership fee, that fee however, is not a fixed amount but instead what you feel that this service is worth and what fits in your economic situation. It can be as small as the simply the creditcard transaction cost or as large as you wish.',

    'welcome_paragraph5' => 'As a consumer you will be able to track your orders and when you need to pick them up. In the not-to-distant future we intend to also give you the ability to mark your orders as “paid” as well as giving the producer the ability to mark orders with “payment recived”.',

    'welcome_paragraph9' => '<b>This is a beta-release.</b> That means this is public-testing of the product. We hope you wont encounter too many bugs och inconsistencies on the site but we need your help testing it to get it off the ground. And besides, we don’t want to wait to give this to the local food communities so we are happy to offer the tool to us all right now!',
