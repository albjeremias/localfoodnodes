        <h4>2015 STARTED AS A PRE-STUDY</h4>
        <p>The project took its start in the late summer of 2015, after several years of been an idéa how to start trade with local food. The start took place within the pre-study "Småskalig konsumentstödd matproduktion (CSA)" lead by Albin Ponnert, as project leader employed by the organization “whole Sweden shall live”, on the subject of CSA and trade of local food, without intermediaries.</p>

        <h4>2016 BYGDENS SALUHALL - SWEDEN\'S FIRST DELIVERY SPOT FOR LOCAL FOOD</h4>
        <p>In the beginning of 2016, the concept development of direct trade of local produced food began, as well as the technical implementations of the digital prototype platform "Bygdens Saluhall". The following summer we set up Sweden\'s first delivery point for local food without intermediaries in the village Röstånga; Bygdens Saluhall Röstånga</p>

        <h4>2017 LOCAL FOOD NODES, AN OPEN SOURCE DIGITAL PLATFORM</h4>
        <p>In the fall of 2016 we started working on the next phase of the project, an open digital infrastructure. In May 2017 the site Local Food Nodes was released as an open tool for trading and organizing local food.</p>

        <h4>2018 LOCAL FOOD APP</h4>
        <p>In June 2018 we move into the next phase of the project by releasing the Local Food App mobile app. A tool that will further simplify the trade of locally-produced food, without intermediaries. We hope and believe the app will tear further obstacles on the way to making the food more local again.</p>
