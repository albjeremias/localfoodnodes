        <p>I\'m a webdeveloper comfortable working both back-end and front-end. I get a kick out of small fast projects that go from nothing to awesome in a few weeks but prefer to work in large complex systems where writing efficient, self explaining and maintainable code is important.</p>
        <p>I dream about living on a farm producing my own food, minimizing the need for money and spending time being in the moment doing what I love.</p>
