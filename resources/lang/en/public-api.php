We cheer for an Internet that enhance and drive real human relations where we as individuals feel secure in never being tools for unknown purposes, tracked in our behaviours and used to make money and impact without our knowledge.</p>
            <p>We believe none of us has to be the product in order to connect.</p>
            <p>In order to be able to do this, instead of traditional online business models, Local Food Nodes is build on transparency and a gift economy. So, wanna get hooked up with great locally produce, digitally supported and eased by this smooth tool, support as with us much as suits you, and we will try to make magic.</p>
