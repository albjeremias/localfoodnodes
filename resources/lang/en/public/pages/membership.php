        <p><strong>When you become a supporting member you are co-funding the future of food. Together, all of us as supporting members, can choose the direction of local food development in the future.</strong></p>
        <p>The supporting membership fees are used to increase the amount of food produced and consumed locally. These funds will help support local farming, local distribution, incresed local food access and strenghtened local economies. It is used to increse the percentage of food we eat that is produced by farmers we know personally.</p>
        <p>Local Food Nodes is an open source tool that will help crowdfund the needed infrastructure, models and intiatives in order to relocalize the food system. We do this together with the membership fees that we all self-determine the size of. </p>',

In the same vain we see the necessity for the platform, development tools and our contributed economic means to be totally transparent.</p>

    <p>This is why Local Food Nodes is open source and all economic transactions, how much we recieve in support, what the costs are and how and why money is spent will be accessible for anyone to view. We are also creating metrics around our goals of increasing local food relationships, local circulation of money and shortening the distance of food which we are going to publish on the site.</p>

    <p>We are also creating a governing structure for the platform and organisation where developers, node admins, producers and consumers will all have a say on how development should proceed and funds be used. More information about this will be available soon.</p>',
